      If you want to learn how to get bigger biceps fast then youâ€™ve come to
      the right place. In this video, you will see how to build big biceps by
      doing the opposite of what you likely have been doing up to now. It is
      going to require that you use light weights and focus more on the
      quality of the contractions of the biceps muscle on every rep rather
      than curling heavy weights and overdeveloping patterns that are already
      holding back your gains.
