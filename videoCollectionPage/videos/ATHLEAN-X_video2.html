      How you eat will definitely have an effect on how you gain muscle
      naturally. That said, itâ€™s not just about consuming enough calories to
      support new muscle growth. The types of food you eat and the nutrient
      density of these foods can go a long way to provide additional benefits
      to the process of muscle growth and protein synthesis.
